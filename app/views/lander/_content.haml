          Promoting Civil Problem
          %br
          Solving in Idaho
        %p.lead
          During 2016, City Club is focusing much of its programming around the Civility Project, including at
          our traditional lunch forums, tours, and salons, as well as at our new After Hours events. Forums will
          address civility in arenas like social media; courts; government and politics; education; faith; and
          business. You’ll hear speakers share how the principles of civil discourse guide their work and inspire
          solutions, such as creating specialized courts for veterans and reducing bullying in schools.
          Throughout the project, City Club intends to convene Civility Roundtables with university policy
          centers, community organizations, and other partners to identify cooperative program offerings,
          evaluate results and explore opportunities to sustain the momentum for a second year.

          Why
        %p.lead
          We want Idaho and its cities
          to be national examples of communities that address
          differences civilly. The goal of the Civility Project is not
          to make everyone agree; rather, we hope to help people
          learn how to disagree while remaining agreeable. This
          year-long project offers Idaho leaders and citizens
          tools to move toward resolution and action when those
          involved don’t see eye-to-eye on the issues. It’s about
          listening to and incorporating dissenting voices so that
          everyone is heard, moving civility from an abstract
          notion to an expected code of conduct.

            an evening with a professor (or professorial panel) to discuss how society has defined and practiced
