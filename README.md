# City Club of Boise Civility Project

This is a placeholder website for the civility project website.  It will likely be redone completely, but for now this will work.

This placeholder is based on the Ruby on Rails template found at [https://github.com/rdnewman/start_bootstrap_landing_page](https://github.com/rdnewman/start_bootstrap_landing_page), which in turn is based on theBootstrap theme found at [http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/landing-page/](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/landing-page/) (retrieved 10/28/2015).   Please see those project for any license details.

Right now, this landing page only has static content (so RoR isn't very necessary), but is ready to work with Postgres on Heroku in case we go that direction.
